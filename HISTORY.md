## 1.3.2 (2014-10-09)

* Fixed: Ensure `#constantize` is called on `Job` instance.

## 1.3.1 (2014-08-13)

* Fixed: Job would infinitely retry if DirtyExit exception was always raised.

## 1.3.0 (2014-07-25)

* Adjust gem dependency on `resque-scheduler` to ~> 3.0
* Deprecated: `args_for_retry` in favor of `retry_args` (will output deprecation

## 1.2.0 (2014-05-19)

* Fixed scenario where job does not get retried correctly when `perform` is not

## 0.2.0 (2011-11-22)

**INCLUDES NON-BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE CHANGES**

* IMPORTANT: `retry_limit` behaviour has changed. (Nicolas Fouch√©)
    PREVIOUSLY: 0 == infinite retries.
           NOW: -1 == infinite retries; 0 == means never retry.

* Bugfix: `#redis_retry_key` incorrectly built key when custom identifier was
  used. (Bogdan Gusiev)
* Feature: Ability to sleep worker after re-queuing a job, may be used to bias
  against the same worker from picking up the job again. (Michael Keirnan)
* Feature: Ability to remove retry jobs using resque-web. (Thiago Morello)
* Added example demo application.
* Added Bundler `Gemfile`.

## 0.1.0 (2010-08-29)

* Feature: Multiple failure backend with retry suppression.
* Feature: resque-web tab showing retry information.
